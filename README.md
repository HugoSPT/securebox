Share files between users (like Dropbox) using security mechanisms

This project was developed and implemented by my and two colleagues during our Computer Science course.

It is a file share APP (like Dropbox) but intended to use some security mechanisms. Files are encrypted before sending, stay encrypted on the server, there is keys exchange between users (who can see the file), etc.
